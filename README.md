Panda Smart Crop Recommendation System is an AI-powered web application designed to help farmers and agricultural advisors make informed crop planting decisions based on environmental and soil conditions. By analyzing key factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil nutrients (N, P, K), the system recommends the most suitable crops for a specific region or field.

🌾 Key Features
🌡️ Analyzes environmental factors (temperature, rainfall, humidity)

🧪 Evaluates soil nutrients: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)

🤖 Utilizes machine learning (Naive Bayes) for accurate crop prediction

📊 Simple and intuitive web interface for input and results

🌍 Helps increase crop yield and optimize land use

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Machine Learning with Naive Bayes)

Flask for web integration.

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (Frontend UI)

Git & GitHub for version control

🚀 How It Works
Users input soil and climate data into the web form.

The system processes the data through a trained machine learning model.

A list of optimal crops is recommended based on the analysis.

📌 Project Goals
Support sustainable farming with data-driven insights

Reduce trial-and-error in crop selection

Empower farmers through accessible AI tools
